## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{webr}
for (x in 1:5) {
  print(x * 2)
}
```

```{pyodide}
for x in range(5):
  print(x * 2)
```

```{webr}
#| edit: false
#| autorun: true
df <- data.frame(foo = c(1, 2, 3), bar = c(10, 20, 30))
df$foo
df$bar
```
